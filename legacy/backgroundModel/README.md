These files define the geometry used to build a background model 

- Complete shielding (copper, lead, polyethilene and water tank)

- A layer or air around the vessel used to simulate radon

- Complete enclosing vessel 

- Mylar cathode, teflon and copper frames.

- Field cage and copper rings. 

- Readout: Mesh, gap, Micromegas and Micromegas supports.

- Target gas volume in the active volume and gas outside this volume. 

- Limandes and electronic conectors

To be done: a pdf document to show a quick visualization and geometrical parameters used in each component.

Important: variables as ${GAS} (name as appearing in https://sultan.unizar.es/materials/materials.xml)  and ${PRESSURE} (in bar) and quencher fraction: ${QUENCHER}) (in %) need to be defined in a launcher sh script
