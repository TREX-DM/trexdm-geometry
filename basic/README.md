These files define a very basic geometry without great detail but integrating the most important components. 

- Complete enclosing vessel 

- Mylar cathode

- Field cage

- Micromegas supports.

- Target gas volume filling any empty space inside the vessel

The file `description.pdf` shows a quick visualization and geometrical parameters used in each component.
