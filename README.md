# TREX-DM geometry
This repository is meant to contain all the geometry related files for use in the TREX-DM experiment simulations. As we use [restG4](https://github.com/rest-for-physics/restG4) (an interface to [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) software) for montecarlo simulations of radiation transport, the geometry of the experiment must be written at the endpoint in [gdml](https://indico.cern.ch/event/408139/contributions/979922/attachments/815913/1118019/GDML_CHEP06.pdf) format.
